      "reasoning": "Jalen Hurts and Jonathan Taylor lead the charge for She Bledsoe I\u2019m Good, and while Josh Allen is impressive, even he can't carry a team full of 'meh' RBs like Derrick Henry and Kyren Williams against a solid lineup."

      "reasoning": "Maxsauers13's star-studded roster, led by Lamar Jackson and Saquon Barkley, is too hot to handle for a squad rolling with Brock Purdy and a no-name RB duo. Sorry, Brock, this isn\u2019t a fairy tale!"

      "reasoning": "Hit it From the Dak has the firepower with Dak and CeeDee Lamb against DerekCal4's mix of unproven players. He\u2019s got Marvin Harrison, but when your QB is Jayden Daniels, I\u2019m skeptical."
